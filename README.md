Exercise - selection process 

The file cluster.py contains code for reading and clustering data.
If you are in the same folder as cluster.py it can be run by typing cluster.py and hit enter.
A window will then pop up asking the user to upload data.
First click on the button "Browse" and select the file containing the data.
Note: The data must be in the form of a json-file.
Then click on the button "Submit". The clustered groups will then be printed on the screen 
and a new window will pop up with a dendrogram plot.
Note: For the data contained in "interview_exercise_data.json"
the calculated distances between "series_0", "series_1" and "series_2" are so small that the 
bar for this grouping is not very visible in the dendrogram.
