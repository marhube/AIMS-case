#Clustering of time series


The file cluster.py contains code for reading and clustering data.
If you are in the same folder as cluster.py it can be run by typing cluster.py and hit enter.
A window will then pop up asking the user to upload data.
First click on the button "Browse" and select the file containing the data.
Note: The data must be in the form of a json-file.
Then click on the button "Submit". The clustered groups will then be printed on the screen 
and a new window will pop up with a dendrogram plot.


The file "cluster.ipynb"  contains a notebook that can be run with the command 'jupyter notebook√¶
The notebook may be easier to follow than the code in cluster.py. The files "cluster.html" and "cluster.pdf"
displays the output from running the algorithm on the data in interview_exercise_data.json.
